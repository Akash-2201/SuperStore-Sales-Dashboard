SuperStore Sales Analysis and Forecasting Dashboard
Project Overview : 

This project analyzes retail sales data and builds an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize business performance and forecast future sales trends.
In addition to dashboard analytics, an AI-based prediction model was developed using Python and XGBoost to predict future sales and profit based on historical data.


Objectives :

    Analyze sales performance across regions, categories, and customer segments
  
    Visualize key performance indicators (KPIs)
  
    Identify sales and profit trends
  
    Forecast future sales
  
    Predict sales and profit using a machine learning model



Tools & Technologies Used :

    Power BI
  
    Python
  
    Pandas
  
    NumPy
  
    XGBoost
 
    Scikit-learn
 
    Microsoft Excel



Dashboard Features :

 
    Sales, Profit, Orders, and Quantity KPIs
  
    Sales by Region
 
    Sales by Category and Sub-Category
  
    Sales by Payment Mode
  
    Customer Segment Analysis
 
    Monthly Sales and Profit Trends
  
    Interactive Filters and Slicers
  
    Sales Forecasting Visualizations



AI Prediction Model
 
 The machine learning model performs:


    1.Data preprocessing and cleaning
 
    2.Feature engineering using date and categorical variables
 
    3.Training regression models using XGBoost
 
    4.Forecasting future sales and profit
 
    5.Exporting predictions to CSV for visualization in Power BI



How to Run the AI Model

  
  1.Install dependencies:    
         
         pip install -r requirements.txt

  
  2.Run the script:
  
       python  AI_model_predictor

  
  3.The output CSV file will be generated and can be loaded into Power BI.



Business Insights :

    
    Identified top-performing product categories

    
    Observed seasonal trends in monthly sales

   
    Compared regional sales performance

    
    Forecasted future sales patterns using historical data
